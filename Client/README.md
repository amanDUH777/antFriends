## About the Team: 
 
* Our team worked well together and utilized the different strengths we each possessed. We would have liked to finish the original idea of an instant messaging app for developers however from that idea we found a productivity app for developer teams was more up our ally for the time being. From the creation of the productivity app and the knowledge we gained, 
we will now have the ability to move forward with instant messaging app.
